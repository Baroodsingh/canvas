# canvas
my basic canvas projects
These are my very first HTML5 works.
I have done this within the 2 days after I heared about HTML5 Canvas
The first one is a html canvas page I designed.
It has randomly moving 2000 bubbles which interact when the user moves the cursor around the page.
The second one (inside the "soluion" folder) is a canvas where user can draw colourful circles with the mouse.
